![](https://github.com/DrVicki/back-end-development/blob/main/back-end-typographic-header-illustration_277904-9717.jpeg)

Backend development is the skill that powers the web. It does it modestly, without fanfare; allowing people to browse their favorite sites without knowing about all the work put in by the backend developer or team.

## So to help dispel this mystery‚Ä¶what is backend development? How does it work?

In this post, Dr. Vicki Bealman from [DigitalCrafts](https://www.digitalcrafts.com/) writes about the various types of backend languages, what you can do with them as a backend developer, and companies that use them.

Backend development languages handle 'behind-the-scenes' functionality of web applications. 
- Backend code connects the web to a database, manages user connections, and powers the web application itself. 
- Backend development works together with the front end to deliver the final product to the end user.

## What is Backend Development?

Backend development keeps the internet running behind the scenes.

Backend developers primarily focus on how a website works.
- They write code focusing on functionality and logic powering the application they‚Äôre working on; technology never directly viewed by users.  
- The backend technology includes servers, applications, and databases.

Responsibilities of backend programmers may include writing APIs, writing code to interact with a database, creating libraries, working on business processes and data architecture, and so much more. 
- It depends on the specific role and company.

## Front-end Vs Backend Programming
![](https://github.com/DrVicki/back-end-development/blob/main/fe-be.png)

You guessed it!!! The other side of backend development is the front end. 

- The key difference is backend developers build how a website functions, front-end programmers build and design the interface, determining how the site looks to users. 
- Backend web development wites the foundational code to enable websites to process actions users take on the front end, and deliver the correct information in return.

Neither works without the other. The backend is necessary to make the front end work, and you need the front end so people can actually access and interact with the website. 

Backend developers typically earn higher salaries than front-end developers, because backend languages are more technical. 
- The average salary for a backend developer is $101,619/yr, while front-end developers earn $76,929/yr.

**Full-stack developers can work with both backend and front-end technologies**. 

## Backend Development Languages
![](https://github.com/DrVicki/back-end-development/blob/main/be-lang.jpeg)

Backend programming is either object-oriented (OOP) or functional.
- Object-oriented is the technique which focuses on creation of objects. 
  - In object-oriented programming, statements should be executed in a specific order. 
  - Popular OOP languages are Java, .NET, and Python.
- Functional programming is more ‚Äúaction‚Äù-based. 
  - Functional programming uses declarative language, where statements can be executed in any order. 
  - It‚Äôs commonly used for data science, and popular languages are SQL, F#, and R.

Languages can either be statically typed or dynamically typed. 
- Statically typed is more rigid, yet more effective at catching errors. 
- Dynamically typed is more flexible but allows for variables to change types (which may be a reason for unexpected errors). 

## 7 Popular Backend Programming Languages

Let's review specific backend development languages and what they‚Äôre used for.

### Backend Language #1: Java
![](https://github.com/DrVicki/back-end-development/blob/main/Java.png)

[Java](https://www.java.com/en/) is the world‚Äôs most popular programming language; and for good reason. 
- Java extremely versatile (its use spans from smartphones to smart cards). 
- Java has also been used by developers for over 20 years.

What makes Java so versatile is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
- With many development languages, compiling a program creates code which may run differently if the computers it runs on are different. 
  - This is not the case for Java because of the JVM. 
    - The Java Virtual Machine acts like a middle layer to run code on any computer, regardless of where the code was compiled.

Java is extremely popular with desktop and business software developers, butless beginner-friendly than a language like Python. 
- Java is verbose and requires more code to build features; as a result, it‚Äôs less rewarding to those just starting out.

However; Java‚Äôs longstanding popularity and diverse uses make it's community large. 
- Questions you may have about Java will likely have forum threads and online tutorials dedicated to answering it.

üí° **WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH JAVA**

Java backend technologies can be used to achieve many objectives, including these and more: 

- (Android) mobile application development
- Website development
- Database connectivity
- Image processing
- GUI based programs

### Backend Language #2: PHP
![](https://github.com/DrVicki/back-end-development/blob/main/php.png)

PHP powers 78.2% of all websites whose server-side programming language we know. 
- PHP was first released in 1995 when there were few options for building dynamic websites.

PHP is dynamically typed, so you can develop a variety of solutions and workarounds for one problem. 
- It also means the same snippet of code can mean something different depending on the context, making programs written in PHP tricky to scale and sometimes slow to run.

PHP is a great language to learn for those who are just starting out for a number of reasons:
- It‚Äôs more forgiving of errors, so you can compile and run a program until you reach a problematic part.
- There are numerous resources dedicated to PHP as a result of the large community and tool support.
  - PHP undergoes updates, so ensure you‚Äôre learning from an up-to-date tutorial.
- Setup is somewhat easy compared to a language like Ruby on Rails. 
  - Download MAMP (for Macs) or WAMP (for Windows) and be ready to go in 5 minutes.

üí° **WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH PHP**

Per the [PHP website](https://www.php.net/), you can: 

- Collect form data
- Generate dynamic page content
- Send and receive cookies
- Write command line scripting
- Write server-side scripting
- Write desktop applications

### Backend Language #3: .NET (C#, VB)
![](https://github.com/DrVicki/back-end-development/blob/main/net.png)

[ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet) is Microsoft‚Äôs answer to Sun Microsystem‚Äôs (now, Oracle) Java. 
- The web application framework is used to build websites using languages like Visual Basic (VB), C#, F#, and more.

The MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern allows backend development duties to be handled by a controller, which interacts with a model to process data. 
- The result is rendered to the view for display as a frontend web page.

Made open source in 2016, .NET can integrate with iOS, Linux, and Android by way of .NET Core. 
- The code is highly stable and reliable, making it popular for businesses. 
- Because it is a Microsoft product, there is great support available if you ever get lost.

### C#
![](https://github.com/DrVicki/back-end-development/blob/main/csharp.png)

C# is a high-level computer language, allowing developers to write programs independent of type of computer. Languages like these write and read more like human languages rather than machine languages.

[C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) is popular among developers because it has the power of C++ (another backend language) but is easier to use because it error-proofs commands that tend to trip up C++ users.

Programmers on Stack Overflow have praised the language for its ‚Äúcool syntax.‚Äù

### VB
![](https://github.com/DrVicki/back-end-development/blob/main/vb2.jpeg)

[VB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/) is a programming language using a graphical user interface (GUI) to modify code written in the BASIC programming language. It‚Äôs an easy language to start with because of its straightforward syntax and its widespread use. As a result, it‚Äôs often used for prototyping.

The drawback of coding with VB is the large amount of memory required to install and run GUI-based development tools.

üí° **WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH .NET**

- Build desktop applications
- Create mobile apps
- Build web applications and games
- Work with Big Data
- And more

üíº **COMPANIES THAT USE .NET**

- [Docplanner](https://integrations.docplanner.com/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

### Backend Language #4: Ruby

[Ruby on Rails](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) (or Ruby) is a web development language built on top of the Ruby programming language. 
- Ruby on Rails has a set of tools to simply create basic tasks (e.g. you‚Äôre able to create a basic blog with one line of code).

Ruby involves little backend work, enabling developers to create and launch applications quickly. 
- It is similar to Python because it is fantastic for prototyping. 
- Ruby grew in popularity in the early 2000s as a result but has declined since then.
- Ruby is open source, which means it can be modified and built upon.

üí° **WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH RUBY**

- Automate repetitive tasks
- Build web applications 
- Build mobile applications and games
- Create prototypes
- And more

üíº **COMPANIES THAT USE RUBY**

## Backend Language #5: Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is the fastest-growing programming language. 
- The versatile language is used for both web and desktop development. 
- Like with Java, there are plenty of tutorials and guides online, making it an accessible language for those just starting out.

Also, its syntax is simple and easy to understand compared to other backend languages. 
- Those who program with Python have applauded it for its ‚Äúelegant,‚Äù ‚Äúreadable,‚Äù and ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù code on Stack Overflow.

Ruby and Python share similarities. 
- They are both dynamically typed, open source, and object-oriented languages. 
- The key differences are in popularity (Ruby is declining whereas Python is skyrocketing) and the tools in Ruby‚Äôs language.

üí° **WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH PYTHON**

Some of the most popular uses for Python include:

- Cross-platform shell scripting
- Quick automation
- Simple web development

üíº **COMPANIES WHO USE PYTHON**

## Backend Language #6: SQL

Structured Query Language or [SQL](https://www.mysql.com/) (pronounced ‚Äòsequel‚Äô) is the most common query language. 
- SQL is used to interact with databases.

SQL is great for beginners to learn because it‚Äôs a declarative language. 
- A declarative language permits coders to ‚Äòdeclare‚Äô the results they would like to see, without specifying the steps or process for said result.

A query language like SQL is great for developers who want to take advantage of the wealth of knowledge stored in databases.


üí° **WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH SQL**

SQL is used to access, manipulate, and create databases.

People who work closely with data can benefit from learning SQL. 
- This includes financial analysts, data-driven marketers, or online entrepreneurs. 
- SQL is an ideal stepping stone for those who want to dive into the world of Big Data.

üíº **COMPANIES THAT USE SQL**

Since SQL is a query language, its use is broad and widespread. 
- If a company or enterprise has a database, it is extremely probable that they are using SQL to query it.

## Backend Language #7: JavaScript

Not related Java, [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) is a language  used for both the front end and back end.

It‚Äôs a great language for beginners because it is a higher-level language and there is little setup involved (you can start coding in your browser).

Because the language is so flexible, objects created in this language are slow. It is also difficult to maintain and scale, as with most dynamically typed languages.

The language is ubiquitous, which means the community is large; providin resources and opportunities for employment if you know JavaScript backend technologies.

üí° **WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH JAVASCRIPT**

JavaScript can be used to build many types of sites and software, including:

- Websites
- Mobile apps 
- Desktop applications
- Games
- Web servers
- Presentations
- And more
