Backend development is the skill that powers the web. It does it modestly, without fanfare; allowing people to browse their favorite sites without knowing about all the work put in by the backend developer or team.

## So to help dispel this mystery‚Ä¶what is backend development? How does it work?

In this post, Dr. Vicki Bealman from DigitalCrafts writes about the various types of backend languages, what you can do with them as a backend developer, and companies that use them.

Backend development languages handle 'behind-the-scenes' functionality of web applications. 
- Backend code connects the web to a database, manages user connections, and powers the web application itself. 
- Backend development works together with the front end to deliver the final product to the end user.

## What is Backend Development?

Backend development keeps the internet running behind the scenes.

Backend developers primarily focus on how a website works.
- They write code focusing on functionality and logic powering the application they‚Äôre working on; technology never directly viewed by users.  
- The backend technology includes servers, applications, and databases.

Responsibilities of backend programmers may include writing APIs, writing code to interact with a database, creating libraries, working on business processes and data architecture, and so much more. 
- It depends on the specific role and company.

## Front-end Vs Backend Programming

You guessed it!!! The other side of backend development is the front end. 

- The key difference is backend developers build how a website functions, front-end programmers build and design the interface, determining how the site looks to users. 
- Backend web development wites the foundational code to enable websites to process actions users take on the front end, and deliver the correct information in return.

Neither works without the other. The backend is necessary to make the front end work, and you need the front end so people can actually access and interact with the website. 

Backend developers typically earn higher salaries than front-end developers, because backend languages are more technical. 
- The average salary for a backend developer is $101,619/yr, while front-end developers earn $76,929/yr.

**Full-stack developers can work with both backend and front-end technologies**. 

## Backend Development Languages

Backend programming is either object-oriented (OOP) or functional.
- Object-oriented is the technique which focuses on creation of objects. 
  - In object-oriented programming, statements should be executed in a specific order. 
  - Popular OOP languages are Java, .NET, and Python.
- Functional programming is more ‚Äúaction‚Äù-based. 
  - Functional programming uses declarative language, where statements can be executed in any order. 
  - It‚Äôs commonly used for data science, and popular languages are SQL, F#, and R.

Languages can either be statically typed or dynamically typed. 
- Statically typed is more rigid, yet more effective at catching errors. 
- Dynamically typed is more flexible but allows for variables to change types (which may be a reason for unexpected errors). 

## 7 Popular Backend Programming Languages

Let's review specific backend development languages and what they‚Äôre used for.

### Backend Language #1: Java

[Java](https://www.java.com/en/) is the world‚Äôs most popular programming language; and for good reason. 
- Java extremely versatile (its use spans from smartphones to smart cards). 
- Java has also been used by developers for over 20 years.

What makes Java so versatile is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
- With many development languages, compiling a program creates code which may run differently if the computers it runs on are different. 
  - This is not the case for Java because of the JVM. 
    - The Java Virtual Machine acts like a middle layer to run code on any computer, regardless of where the code was compiled.

Java is extremely popular with desktop and business software developers, butless beginner-friendly than a language like Python. 
- Java is verbose and requires more code to build features; as a result, it‚Äôs less rewarding to those just starting out.

However; Java‚Äôs longstanding popularity and diverse uses make it's community large. 
- Questions you may have about Java will likely have forum threads and online tutorials dedicated to answering it.

üí° **WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH JAVA**

- [Evernote](https://dev.evernote.com/)
- [FitBit](https://dev.fitbit.com/)
- [Hubspot](https://developers.hubspot.com/)

### Backend Language #2: PHP

PHP powers 78.2% of all websites whose server-side programming language we know. 
- PHP was first released in 1995 when there were few options for building dynamic websites.

PHP is dynamically typed, so you can develop a variety of solutions and workarounds for one problem. 
- It also means the same snippet of code can mean something different depending on the context, making programs written in PHP tricky to scale and sometimes slow to run.

PHP is a great language to learn for those who are just starting out for a number of reasons:
- It‚Äôs more forgiving of errors, so you can compile and run a program until you reach a problematic part.
- There are numerous resources dedicated to PHP as a result of the large community and tool support.
  - PHP undergoes updates, so ensure you‚Äôre learning from an up-to-date tutorial.
- Setup is somewhat easy compared to a language like Ruby on Rails. 
  - Download MAMP (for Macs) or WAMP (for Windows) and be ready to go in 5 minutes.

üí° **WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH PHP**

Per the [PHP website](https://www.php.net/), you can: 

- Collect form data
- Generate dynamic page content
- Send and receive cookies
- Write command line scripting
- Write server-side scripting
- Write desktop applications
